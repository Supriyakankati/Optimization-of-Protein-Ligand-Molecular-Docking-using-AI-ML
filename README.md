# Optimization-of-Protein-Ligand-Molecular-Docking-using-AI-ML

Introduction:
Molecular docking is an in-silico method widely utilized in early-stage drug discovery for

Screening promising drug candidates.
Exploring potential side effects or toxicities.
Traditionally, tools like AutoDock4 (AD4) and AutoDock Vina (Vina) estimate protein-ligand binding affinities using heuristic scoring functions, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. 

However, these methods face several challenges,

Limited ability to capture nuanced molecular interactions.
Rigid receptor assumptions.
Inaccuracies in pose prediction for complex or flexible systems.
These limitations result in inefficiencies, where only 20-30% of compounds identified through molecular docking show activity in biological assays. While AD4 and Vina remain valuable for initial screenings, their results often require refinement to align with experimental outcomes.

Proposed Framework: 
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) with traditional docking software.

Key Features
Graph-based Modeling: GCNs model protein-ligand complexes as graph data, capturing intricate molecular interactions.
Enhanced Prediction: Improved accuracy in predicting binding affinities and identifying favorable configurations.
Hybrid Approach: Combines traditional tools (AD4, Vina) with GCN outputs to optimize docking results.
This integrated method leverages machine learning to refine molecular docking patterns, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The approach aims to:

Reduce inaccuracies in docking predictions.
Minimize the time and costs associated with drug discovery.
